# MachineLearning_for_SignalProcessing
This is the repository for storing my assignments in "Machine Learning for Signal Processing", this course at Technical University of Denmark. 
The problems' descriptions are in the "Problem_set_2.pdf" and "Problem_set_3.pdf", and my answers are in the "Assignment_2.pdf" and "Assignment_3.pdf".
There are some coding problems I answered in notebooks or python files.
